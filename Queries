## These are the hardest and most complicated queries i built for the last quiz. 
## (The last Quiz had 15 questions. These are two of the last. The prior questions were prepering you for the last ones)

## Question 1
## Write a query that determines the month in which each store had its maximum number of sku units returned. During
## which month did the greatest number of stores have their maximum number of sku units returned?

SELECT	CASE	when max_month_table.month_num = 1 then 'January'

## Question 2
## Which department within a particular store had the greatest decrease in average daily sales revenue from August to
## September, and in what city and state was that store located?

SELECT 	s.city, s.state, d.deptdesc, t.store,

## This is the last query I built for the semi-final quiz.
SELECT	CASE	when msa_high between 50 and 60 then 'low'
		when msa_high between 60 and 70 then 'medium'
  		when msa_high > 70 then 'high'

	SUM(CASE WHEN HSE='low' THEN Revenue/NS END) as lowEd,
	SUM(CASE WHEN HSE='medium' THEN Revenue/NS END) as mediumEd,
	SUM(CASE WHEN HSE='high' THEN Revenue/NS END) as highEd

		(
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT saledate) as NS,
 		(EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)||EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)) as yearmonth,
		store,
		SUM(amt) as Revenue,
 		CASE	WHEN (EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=8 and EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)=2005) or (stype<>'P') THEN 'Yes'
